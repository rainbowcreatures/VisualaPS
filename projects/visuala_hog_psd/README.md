#Hidden Object Game Engine
The most complex example at the time of first release. Demonstrates how to create a simple HOG engine - it uses some dynamic methods to 
build up list of hidden objects. It also takes advantage of layer classes and properties, demonstrates a simple game menu (buttons, sliders, popups) and 
last but not least, using storage to save or load game progress. 

You should be able to create multiple rooms using the same engine, maybe extend it into a full game - you are certainly welcome to give it a try and let us know!

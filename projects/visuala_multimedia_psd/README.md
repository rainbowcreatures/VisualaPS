#Book with text reading
This demonstrates the use of the "karaoke" plugin. With our workflow, it should be pretty easy to create apps which highlight spoken word (ideal for apps for kids, for example). 
The process of speech-to-text (and highlighting) is automated thanks to our own extension based on CMU Sphinx. You just use Karaoke block to target into which layer the highligted text goes.

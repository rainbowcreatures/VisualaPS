# VisualaPS example projects

Initially, these are the "seed" projects we're using to extend functionality of VisualaPS. Hopefully this will grow in time as more projects are added. You're welcome to modify or extend the apps, or create your own apps of them (all of those projects have MIT license).

Submit your own VisualaPS projects! Please create an Issue first, describing your example project - only after your project is approved we'll take your pull request.

## Installing the example projects

The projects must be unzipped into C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Documents\VisualaPhotoshopProjects\
